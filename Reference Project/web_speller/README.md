Settings

Basic Commands
--------------

#### Setting Up Your Users

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. 
Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your 
console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your 
browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command:

```
    $ docker-compose run --rm app ./manage.py createsuperuser
```

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your 
superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site 
behaves for both kinds of users.


#### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

```
    $ docker-compose run --rm app pytest --cov-report html --cov . --verbose
    $ open backend/htmlcov/index.html
```

#### Running tests with py.test

```
  $ docker-compose run --rm app pytest .
```
